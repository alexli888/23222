;; Problem 2: Now that you have Racket installed, hit run in the upper right hand corner.
;;            You should see, in the interactions window below
;;            a picture of francesca with her name superimposed

;;            You may not understand all of the code or vocabulary here, but this is just to be a runnable example showing off
;;            several topics we will go into soon
;;            You may benefit from looking at the Course Calendar and seeing if any of the vocabulary appears in the topics or video lecture titles
;;            to know when we plan to cover them

;; Problem 3 - Uncomment and fill in the ...s with values of the appropriate type
;;             

;; 3a uncomment the following constant and replace the ... with an image that is small, square dimensions, and represents you
;;    (A picture of you is prefered as I am going to use these to learn everyone's names and faces,
;;    but you can use a picture of something you like instead if you do not want to use a picture of yourself)

; (define ME_IMG ...) ; You can either copy-paste an image or use the Insert menu from the toolbar 

(define ME_IMG. )

;; 3b uncomment the following constant and replace the ... with how you like to be called
;;    (Either your first name, a nick name, etc.)
; (define EX_ME "his")
; (define ME ...)

(define ME "Alex")

;; 3c uncomment the following constant and replace the ... with what possessive adjective you use
;;    (so that it makes sense in the comic below)

; (define EX_PADJ "his")
; (define ME_PADJ ...)

(define ME_PADJ "his")

;; 3c replace the ...s with numbers to finish the emoji comic
;; Steps:
;;  1) Copy the code out of the comment
;;  2) Replace all the ...s with 0s so the code runs without error
;;  3) Look at the result
;;  4) Guess and check different numbers instead of 0 until the center panel looks like a thought bubble
